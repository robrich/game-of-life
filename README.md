Conway's Game of Life
=====================

I wanted to build [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

Implimentation detail: I used Vue.js to visualize the results.

The Game of Life engine is in `/src/services`.

Thanks to [Venkat Subramaniam](https://saltmarch.com/watch/lets-have-some-fun-with-game-of-life-and-learn-to-think-functionally-along-the-way) for the inspiration to build this. (His solution is better.)
